"Gostei muito do produto, por√©m a c√¢mera frustou um pouco a expectativa em compara√ß√£o ao Xaiomi chin√™s.",4
"O aparelho tem boa usabilidade, tamanho x peso, bateria aguenta firme e as imagens s√£o muito boas. O ponto negativo foi que o carregador chegou com padr√£o europeu de pinos, me obrigando a comprar um adaptador.",4
No momento estou gostando do produto em si,4
"O carregador n√£o entra em nenhuma tomada, n√£o sei porque n√£o enviam junto um adaptador j√° que a Amazon sabe que tal pino n√£o serve no Brasil.",4
"A √∫nica coisa que eu n√£o gostei foi o carregador, veio com o plug da tomada incompat√≠vel com as tomadas atuais e o cabo veio de cor diferente da fonte.",4
"O smartphone √© bem leve, a tela tem um bom tamanho, √≥tima resolu√ß√£o, muito espa√ßo interno, fun√ß√µes r√°pidas e a cor do aparelho √© bem bonita. Bom custo benef√≠cio para o uso do dia a dia, redes sociais, navega√ß√£o de internet, transa√ß√µes banc√°rias, fotos e v√≠deos (√≥tima resolu√ß√£o e diversas fun√ß√µes). Carregamento bem r√°pido e bateria dura bastante. Estou com o aparelho h√° uma semana e n√£o apresentou problemas, mas como usu√°rio m√©dio n√£o fui al√©m para testar as capacidades do aparelho. Pontos negativos √© o touch digital q fica atr√°s do aparelho, apesar de bem pensado para o uso (sem capa) achei um pouco pequeno e √†s vezes n√£o reconhece, talvez para um dedo maior seja mais trabalhosa a precis√£o.
A entrega foi demorada (e atrasou em um dia), p√©ssimo para os padr√µes do Prime (era quando fiz a compra), talvez porque veio pelo Correio, mas chegou sem problemas apesar da caixa do aparelho estar ""solta"" dentro da caixa do vendedor. Minha sugest√£o para o revendedor √© talvez colocar uns krafts amassados ou outra coisa para minimizar o ""vai e vem"". De resto estou bem satisfeito com o aparelho.",4

"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing
üá© üá™ üá∏ üáÆ üá¨ üá≥ 
Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.
üá© üáÆ üá∏ üáµ üá± üá¶ üáæ 
The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.
üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜà
The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?
üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞
There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",4
Awesome products,4
Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price,4
"J√° faz um m√™s da minha compra e eu realmente n√£o gostei. Ele demora umas quatro horas pra carregar e isto me incomoda muito e sem contar que a bateria n√£o tem toda aquela durabilidade esperada, a n√£o ser que n√£o use, √© claro! N√£o compraria novamente e n√£o recomendo.",3
"De acordo com o an√∫ncio, mas de fraco desempenho at√© para tarefas do dia a dia. N√£o vale metade do pre√ßo.",3
